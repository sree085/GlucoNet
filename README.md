# GlucoNet - AI-Powered Diabetes Prediction Web App

![GlucoNet Logo](static/ecg-logo.png)

## 🧠 Abstract

**GlucoNet** is an AI-based web application designed to predict the risk of diabetes using essential health parameters. The application leverages a **Random Forest Classifier** trained on key features such as:

- Pregnancies  
- Blood Glucose  
- Blood Pressure  
- Body Mass Index (BMI)  
- Age  
- Diabetes Pedigree Function (DPF)

These features were selected based on their strong correlation with diabetes onset, ensuring a reliable and explainable model.

## 🧪 How It Works

1. User enters their health metrics into the form.
2. Data is scaled using the trained `scaler.pkl`.
3. The model (`model.pkl`) predicts whether the user is likely diabetic.
4. Result is shown instantly on the same page using a modal popup.
5. Depending on the result, advice or next steps are suggested.
